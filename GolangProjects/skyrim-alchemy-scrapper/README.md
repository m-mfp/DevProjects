# Skyrim Alchemy Ingredient Scraper

## Overview

The Skyrim Alchemy Ingredient Scraper is a command-line application built in Go (Golang) that allows users to scrape and retrieve information about alchemy ingredients and their effects from the game Skyrim. The application provides a simple interface for users to explore the various ingredients and their associated effects.

## Features

- **Ingredient Lookup**: Users can input the name of an ingredient to retrieve its effects.
- **Effect Lookup**: Users can select an effect to see a list of ingredients that provide that effect.
- **Command-Line Interface**: The application is currently accessible through the command line, making it lightweight and easy to use.

## Current Status

This project is still in development, and additional features and improvements are planned for future releases. A complete skyrim alchemy scrapper application is hosted on my GitHub Pages at [m-mfp.github.io/myPortfolio](https://m-mfp.github.io/myPortfolio). Please do go explore it there.

## Usage

To use the application, run it from the command line and follow the prompts to either enter an ingredient or select an effect. The application will return the relevant information based on your input.

`go run .`
